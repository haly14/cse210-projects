# CSE 210 (Programming With Classes) Final Project: Open-Ended

## Project Overview

This program includes gamified methods for reviewing basic facts
about each of the 8 major systems in the human body (Integumentary,
Skeletal, Muscular, Nervous, Circulatory, Respiratory, Digestive, Immune).

## Getting Started

Simply run the program and view the instructions given to the user.

## Usage

This is a good basic framework to start developing a gamified anatomy
app from. Some functions I hope to add in the future: a general color
theme and display, a larger question bank, 1 game and 1 other gamified
quiz method (flashcards?), a fun point display that is visible throughout
app usage, and more extensive lessons on each body system to review
before playing games.
(Note: While the original design included a short answer quiz function, 
I decided that this function did not really make sense for the general
purpose of the app and would not be the best format to test the learner's
knowledge by with no sure way to check the answers. May be possible in the 
future with AI incorporation.)
